# Basic CLI Battler

## Introduction

This system is designed to generate characters and battles between them. It does so by adding data to tables via CLI user input.

## CLI Layout

I've designed my CLI with non-technical user comfort in mind. Upon opening the CLI, the user is prompted with 2 options; a character menu and a battle menu.

The character menu allows the user to either view a list of all characters or generate a new one. If the former option is selected, the user will receive a numbered list of characters, from which they can select one by name or number. Upon doing so, they are given a set of new options to interact with that character. They can view that character's details, update them, or delete them completely. The latter option will also delete any battles the character has participated in.

The battle menu is similar, but doesn't include a sub-menu for each battle. The user has the option of viewing all battles, viewing all battle victors, adding a battle, deleting a battle, updating a battle, or viewing all battles that have taken place at a particular location.
